# Adhere to the commit message guide outlined at
# chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit
# To set this as your default git commit template:
# run `git config commit.template res/.gitmessage` from the repo root
#
# Subject line - Title for the commit
# -------------- Max 50 characters --------------

# Body - Explain what changes this commit makes and why they are
# necessary
# ---------- Max line length should not exceed 72 characters ----------

# General guidelines:
#   Do not end the subject line with a period
#   Capitalize the first letter in the subject
#   Use the imperative mood - ie. use 'Fix' instead of 'Fixed'
#   Explain 'what' and 'why' in the body rather than 'how'
